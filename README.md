# Smashing Pumpkins

This game was developed during my Bootcamp at **Academia de CÃ³digo** (on the 5th week).
Therefore, there's a lot that could be considered *bad code* but, by the time this was made, I didn't have the knowledge to do it in a better way.

### Multi player Game

The goal of the game is to step on the - scarecrows with pumpkin heads - that appear on the field. For that you just need to make your character bump against them.

If you want to try it you can use the following keys to change your character direction:

* Player 1 keys: 
  w, s, a, s -> up, down, left, right

* Player 2 Keys:
  arrows
